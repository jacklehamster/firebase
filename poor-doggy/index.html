<h2><pre><span id="texto">On March 2013, a video of a poor doggy getting
scolded by a Russian lady became viral.
A lot of us couldn't understand what the Russian
lady was saying, but only one thing became clear: 
THE POOR DOGGY WOULD NOT MAKE IT OUT ALIVE!

We never found out what happened to poor doggy,
but this is your chance to save him. In this game,
your goal is to save the poor doggy, by choosing
or creating the dialog that will lead the Russian
lady to forgive poor doggy and turn him into a
HAPPY DOGGY.

Note: This unique experience allows you to create 
the game as it is being played. When you do get a
chance to do that, be mindful about about what 
you post:
YOUR CONTENT WILL SHARED WITH OTHER PLAYERS!
